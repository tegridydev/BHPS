# Black Hole Particle Simulation (BHPS)

BHPS aims to simulate a particle system interacting with a central black hole using Python and PIL (Python Imaging Library).

## Inspo

This repository is a fork inspired by [JoeSzeles/Black-Hole--Planetary-System-Simulator--QI:main](https://github.com/JoeSzeles/Black-Hole--Planetary-System-Simulator--QI).

The inspiration behind this particle simulation with a black hole comes from exploring the dynamics of gravitational interactions in a simulated environment. 

Drawing on concepts from physics and astronomy, this project aims to visualize how particles behave under the influence of a massive central object, akin to a black hole.

## Details

The simulation initializes a number of particles with random positions, velocities, and masses. These particles interact gravitationally with a central black hole based on Newtonian mechanics. The simulation runs for a fixed number of frames, updating particle positions and velocities accordingly. The resulting particle movements are visualized on a canvas and saved as an image.
